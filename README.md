# Item Catalog(PetAdopt)
This web app is a project for the Udacity [FSND Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004).

### Project Overview
> To Develop an application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories as well as provide a user registration and authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items.

### Why This Project?
> Modern web applications perform a variety of functions and provide amazing features and utilities to their users; but deep down, itâ€™s really all just creating, reading, updating and deleting data. In this project, I combined my knowledge of building dynamic websites with persistent data storage to create a web application that provides a compelling service to your users.

### What Did I Learn?
  * Develop a RESTful web application using the Python framework Flask
  * Implementing third-party OAuth authentication.
  * Implementing CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations.
